### Hello there, my name is Jair (Ja-ear) ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
Data Analyst based in Round Rock, TX, with a background in human resources, assisting executives in a medical setting, and collaborating closely with nurses and physicians to ensure optimal patient care. After working in a startup company I gained firsthand experience of the challenges a new business can encounter on a daily basis. Through this experience, I realized the immense potential of data in offering valuable insights across various business facets. This discovery ignited my excitement for the prospect of enhancing products and services in ways I hadn't previously envisioned. Motivated by this, I embarked on a career shift towards data analytics, enrolling in the UT McCombs Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp to expand my knowledge.

Throughout my academic journey, I've not only gained vital technical skills but also developed the analytical mindset necessary for success in this field. I'm both confident and enthusiastic about commencing a new phase in my career, eagerly seeking opportunities for continuous growth and advancement.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently enhancing my understanding of relational databases through various platforms. Currently, my focus is on acquiring knowledge about Microsoft SQL Server and exploring ways to seamlessly integrate a front-end interface using Microsoft Access.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques on Database Design and Database Management.
